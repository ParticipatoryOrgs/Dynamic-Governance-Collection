## Dynamic Governance

Dynamic Governance the generic term for a number of specific organizational management methods that encourage broader participation in the policies and operations of an organization.

There are currently several variations of these methods, in particular Sociocracy and HolacracyÂ®. They all appear to have in common four common practices:

* **Circles**: self-organizing units with autotomy within a limited domain.
* **Double-linking**: Circles are linked together through two people, one for each linked circle into the other circle.
* **Conflict Resolution**: There are methods to resolve objections raised in a circle.
* **Election to Roles**: Circles elect people to functions, tasks and roles within the domain of the circle.
