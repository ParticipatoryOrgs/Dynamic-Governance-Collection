# How to Contribute

The purpose of the [Participatory Orgs Project](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs) is to increase the participation of stakeholders in organizations by sharing a curated set of opinionated Free Cultural Works documents that support participatory organizations, including legal, governance, best practices, and even code.

Our desire is to apply these principles to our own work. Thus enabling third-party contributions to the Project and our repositories is essential for keeping the Participatory Orgs Project great.

We want to keep this process as easy as possible, but there are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can maintain quality and have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).

## Trivial Changes

For changes of a trivial nature to a document in this repository:

* Go to this repository's [issues page](../../issues) and see if anyone else has suggested similar changes. If yes, add a comment showing your support. Otherwise, submit a [new ticket](../../issues/new) in this repository clearly describing your changes. Your ticket will be reviewed by the appropriate team circle, and if there are no objections the changes will be added to the project.

## Substantial Changes

For more substantial changes to an existing document in this repository:

* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR-LICENSE-AGREEMENT.md) in the [Participatory Orgs Community](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community).
* Go to the [issues page](../../issues) in this repository and see if anyone else is suggesting similar changes. If yes, add a comment showing your support. Otherwise, submit a [new ticket](../../issues/new) in this repository clearly describing your changes. Then...
  * Fork the repository on GitHub into your own account.
  * In your fork, make your changes (typically in your master branch).
  * In your commit, write a succinct <40 character summary of your changes, referencing the issue you created, for example "Added new section per #3"), then add more details about the changes in the extended description.
  * If you are using Github interface, before committing review your changes with the Preview tab. Then commit your changes.
  * Return to this master repository, and submit a pull request for your changes.
  * The appropriate circle team will review your ticket and pull request, and if there are no objections add it to the project.
  
## Submitting New Documents

If you wish to add new files to this repository, you may add them as per [Substantial Changes](#substantial-changes) above, or:
* Submit an [issue](../../issues) with a URL referencing the document you wish to submit. All such documents must be licensed under a [Free Cultural Works](https://creativecommons.org/freeworks) license such as CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC0, Public Domain, etc. to be considered.
* Your ticket will be reviewed by the appropriate team circle, and if there are no objections your files will be added to the project.

## New Repositories

If would like to submit a new repository into the project:
* Go to the [Participatory Orgs Community](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community) repository's [Issues](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community/issues) page and see if anyone else is suggesting similar documents. If there are not, then...
  * Create a repository in your own account in GitHub, with a LICENSE.md file with an appropriate [Free Cultural Works](https://creativecommons.org/freeworks) license agreement (we prefer CC-BY).
  * Create a new ticket in the [Participatory Orgs Community](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community) repository's [Issues](https://github.com/ParticipatoryOrgs/ParticipatoryOrgs-Community/issues) that references your repository and clearly describe its purpose and contents.
  * The appropriate circle team will review your ticket, and if there are no objections they will fork the repository into the project, and our version of the project will be listed as a fork of your original project.

## Feedback & Approval

* If the circle team reviewing your submission does not accept the issue or pull request, they may leave the ticket open to request community discussion, or offer feedback as to how to revise the request to have it accepted.
* After feedback has been offered the circle expects response from the submitter within two weeks. After two weeks they may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
